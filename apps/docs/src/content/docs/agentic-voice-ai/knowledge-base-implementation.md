title: Knowledge Base Implementation

* Ingest many asset types: PDFs, DOCX, PPT, Excel, images (OCR), web scrapes, transcripts.
* Use LangChain (or similar) for document loaders, chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
* Store embeddings in a vector DB (Pinecone/Milvus/Weaviate) and query at runtime for RAG context.

Consider:

* Document loaders for each file type (pdf.js, mammoth, xlsx parsers).
* OCR (Tesseract) for images/slides.
* A background ingestion worker (queue + workers) to process new assets.
