title: Actionable Next Steps & TODOs
---

1. **Prototype TS package** — scaffold with the `VoiceSDKConfig` and dual-mode code paths (OpenAI vs customrtc).
2. **Create minimal NestJS orchestrator** — endpoints for session initiation, firing flows, signal exchange.
3. **Build a React Flow demo** — export JSON and POST to orchestrator for execution.
4. **KB ingestion worker** — background job to parse and embed documents.
5. **E2E tests** — simulate a call in both modes and verify latency and transcription quality.
